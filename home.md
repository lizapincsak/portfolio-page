# My Story:

Iâ€™m a Wisconsin girl, whose dream is to own her own farm with a barn. I love exploring the outdoors, different countries, and the inner depths of my soul. 

2019 took me by storm. By bringing in the New Year with a blood clot, I knew it was time to make some drastic changes. One of which was bringing my life-long desire to have a blog to life. 

After trying out all the jobs the past 10+ years, I'm now a former ESL Teacher (yup even got my masters and licenses in education) turned coder (yup I just graduated from Lambda School's Web Development Bootcamp). 

As my grandmother asked, have you finally settled on a career? A beautiful question to which I politely replied I don't know. BUT, I love tech. There's a lot for me to explore here, so I hope you'll join me for the ride by buckling up for safety because it's going to be a bumpy yet wildly fun adventure.
